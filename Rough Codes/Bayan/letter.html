                                work environment. To this end, we want you to bring any problems, concerns, or
                                grievances you have about the work place to the attention of your Administrators and, if
                                necessary, to Human Resources or upper level management. To help manage conflict

                        or entities related to the Academy, bring your concerns to the attention of your Administrators
                        at a time and place that will allow the person to properly listen to your concern. Most problems
                        can be resolved informally through dialogue between you and your immediate Administrators. If
                        you have already brought this matter to the attention of your Administrators before and do not
                        believe you have received a sufficient response, or if you believe that person is the source of
                        the problem, present your concerns to Human Resources or upper level management. Describe the
                        problem, those persons involved in the problem, efforts you have made to resolve the problem,
                        and any suggested solution you may have.</span></p>
